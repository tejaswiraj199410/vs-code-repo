A thirsty crow was flying through a forest, looking everywhere for water. Finally, he saw a pot with some water at the bottom, but his beak couldn’t reach it. The crow didn’t give up. He looked around and noticed some pebbles on the ground. The clever crow started dropping the pebbles into the pot one by one. Slowly, the water rose higher and higher until it was close enough for him to drink. The crow finally quenched his thirst and flew away happily.

Moral of the story: You can solve any problem if you think smart and don’t give up!
